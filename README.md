Tab Grenade
=========

Tab Grenade is a Firefox Browser extension that creates a persistent list of all
your open tabs and then closes them all, similar to what the [OneTab extension
for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en)
does. Think of it as a much more convenient bookmark mechanism.

Tab Grenade is work in progress.
